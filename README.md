# Project2
## 1.1 Problem background
Our project is the solution to the Hibernia-Sino Travel Company who specializes in travel insurance
between Ireland and China. Nowadays, they are moving their workflow processes from
dated desktop software systems to the cloud. According to their requirements, this will enable
customers to update their details, renew their policies, and register claims online.
To meet their needs well, we decided to develop a web application for them. Because web
application is easy to cross-platform and more stable, can work on both PCs and mobile phones.
We also design two subsystems for Hibernia-Sino, one is for their customers and the other is
for their employees. As a customer, you can purchase insurances and file claims online, and the
employee can process the requests at the backstage.
## 1.2 Problem analyzing
To meet the needs of Hibernia-Sino, our system must achieve the following functions and goals:
1. The solution must be cloud-based, and the data should be stored on the cloud.
2. The application should work on both PCs and mobile phones.
3. The application should contain the login and sign up functions, and different accounts can
log in to different systems (customer system, employee system).
4. The application should support the function of system language internationalization (Chinese
& English menu switch).
5. The system should be able to handle lost luggage problems.
• Customers should be able to file lost luggage claims online.
• Customers can trace their claims and check the status or the result of their claims.
• Employees can check the claims they received at the backstage.
• Employees should be able to process these claims online. They can write some
feedbacks and change the status of the claim.
6. The Hibernia-Sino can store their insurance product information in our system.
7. Customer can purchase insurance products online.

As we mention before, we plan to develop a web project, and we will not develop an application
on the mobile end because it will increase our developing pressure. Those who develop the
mobile app will spend more time on maintaining. If a new function needs to be added into our
project, we only need to update the codes in the web end. This will make us keep our mind on
designing more fantastic pages and improve more non-functional requirement. For the mobile
user, the can log in our system by accessing it in a browser. We use bootstrap to guarantee that
the web pages are clean and fast and work well on popular browsers.
